Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/company-account-api.git
cd company-account-api
2. Install dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. Then, install the necessary dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Set up environment variables
Create a .env file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

bash
Copy code
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/companyAccountsDB
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT: The port the server will run on (default is 5000).

MONGO_URI: The MongoDB connection string.

JWT_SECRET: A secret key used for signing JWT tokens.

4. Start MongoDB
If you are using a local MongoDB instance, make sure the MongoDB service is running. You can start MongoDB by running the following command (if MongoDB is installed):

bash
Copy code
net start MongoDB
5. Run the project
Once all dependencies are installed and environment variables are set up, you can start the server by running:

bash
Copy code
node app.js
You should see the following output in the terminal:

pgsql
Copy code
ðŸš€ Server is running on port 5000

Troubleshooting
MongoDB not starting: If MongoDB is not starting, make sure you have installed MongoDB correctly and that it's running on 127.0.0.1:27017.

JWT Issues: Ensure the JWT_SECRET in the .env file is set and that the client includes the token in the Authorization header when making protected API requests.
